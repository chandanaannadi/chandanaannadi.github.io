                    <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse
                        change. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as

                <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
                <p> Air pollution refers to any physical, chemical or biological change in the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that
                    are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to
                    materials.
                </p>
                <h4>Effects of Air Pollution:</h4>
                <p>Greenhouse gases are a natural part of the earth’s atmosphere and help to maintain a stable
                    temperature. Without greenhouse gases, the sun’s energy would escape back into space, freezing the
                    earth into a giant snowball. However, when enough quantities of greenhouse gases accumulate, more of
                    the sun’s energy gets trapped within the earth. Initially, global sea-level increases, ambient
                    temperatures rise, weather becomes more unpredictable and violent. Once this process reaches a
                    tipping point, a hypothetical phenomenon called the Runaway Greenhouse effect occurs.

                <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
                <p>Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise
                    with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of them harmful to a degree. The
                    source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems.
                </p>
                <h4>Effects of Noise Pollution:</h4>
                <p>The noise pollution is very harmful to our health. It does not only create an unpleasant sound for
                    our ears. It also weakens our efficiency internally. The noise pollution brings many serious
                    diseases for humans. Some of these diseases are very harmful and incurable too. Their results are
                    quite terrifying.

                    Many experiments on noise pollution have proved that it decreases the productivity of humans. It
                    also affects the concentration ability, and people feel exhausted in a very short time. The noise
                    pollution puts the worst effect on a pregnant woman. It may result in the abortion of the child.

                <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
                <p>Water pollution is defined as the presence in groundwater of toxic chemicals and biological
                    agents that exceed what is naturally found in the water and may pose a threat to human health
                    and/or the environment. Additionally, water pollution may consist of chemicals introduced into
                    the water bodies as a result of various human activities. Any amount of those chemicals pollutes
                    the water, regardless of the harm they may pose to human health and the environment.

                </p>
                <h4>Effects of Water Pollution:</h4>
                <p>
                    Water pollution can be caused both by natural and human-made reasons. Natural causes like
                    volcanic eruptions and earthquakes affect the quality of water. However, people are more than
                    responsible for damage to water quality. Discharge from industries, factories, sewage treatment
                    plants causes water to get dirty and contaminated with chemicals affecting the life of
                    water-dwelling creatures.

                <h2>Soil Pollution</h2>
                <p>
                    Soil pollution is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in
                    soil, in high enough concentrations to pose a risk to human health and/or the ecosystem. In the
                    case of contaminants which occur naturally in soil, even when their levels are not high enough
                    to pose a risk, soil pollution is still said to occur if the levels of the contaminants in soil
                    exceed the levels that should naturally be present.
                </p>
                <h4>Effects of Soil Pollution:</h4>
                <p>In this blog post, we will discuss the effects of soil pollution. Soil pollution is the
                    contamination of the Earth’s surface with artificial and natural toxic substances. Soil
                    pollutants are often found in areas where industrial or agricultural activities exist. Soil
                    pollution can have many adverse effects on humans and ecosystems.

                    Some of these effects are more severe than others, but they all present a threat to human health
                    and ecosystems.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, environmental pollution is not a modern phenomenon. It began ever since people 'began to congregate in 
towns and cities. The ancient Athenians removed refuse to dumps outside the main parts of their cities. The Romans 
dug trenches outside their cities where they could deposit their garbage, waste and even corpses. These unhygienic 
practices undoubtedly led to the outbreak of viral diseases.Unfortunately, Man refuses to acknowledge or correct his past mistakes. As cities grew in the Middle Ages, pollution became even more evident.
Our planet has its own mechanisms to deal with natural pollutants. Decay, sea spray and volcanic eruptions release 
more sulphur than all the power plants, smelters and industries in the world do.
